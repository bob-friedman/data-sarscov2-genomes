Note: This version of the `nucdiv_stats.py` script used for the initial analysis contains a bug that could inflate π values in the presence of highly divergent sequences. The results presented in the heatmap were generated after applying a filter (π < 0.001) that removed all affected data points. The core methodology has since been updated with a fully validated function for all ongoing and future analyses (to be uploaded).
