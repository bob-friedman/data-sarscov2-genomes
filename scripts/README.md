Note: The `nucdiv_stats.py` script at v1.0.0, used for the initial analysis, contains a bug that could inflate π values in the presence of highly divergent sequences. The results presented in the heatmap of the technical report were generated after applying a filter (π < 0.001) that removed all affected data points. The core methodology has since been updated with a fully validated function for all ongoing and future analyses (`nucdiv_stats_v2.py`).
