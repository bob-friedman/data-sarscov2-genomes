# Data Directory

This directory contains the primary dataset generated by the `nucdiv_v4.py` pipeline.

## File Assembly

The dataset is provided in five compressed parts. To reconstruct the complete `all_clades_aligned.fas` file, first ensure you are in this directory, then run the following command:

```bash
gunzip -c *.fas.gz > all_clades_aligned_combined.fas
```
**Note:** The final, uncompressed file is approximately 7 GB. Please ensure you have sufficient disk space.

## Dataset Description

*   **File:** `all_clades_aligned.fas` (reassembled from parts)
*   **Format:** Multi-FASTA
*   **Content:** Contains 249,000 concatenated consensus genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2.
*   **FASTA Headers:** Headers follow the format `>sample_id|CLADENAME`, where `sample_id` is the original strain identifier and `CLADENAME` is the sanitized Pangolin lineage (e.g., `BA_2_75` for `BA.2.75`).

### Provenance and Generation

*   **Source Data:** The sequences were derived from the UShER mutation-annotated phylogeny, specifically the public release dated **2025-06-29** (`public-2025-06-29.all.masked.pb`).
*   **Reference Genome:** `NC_045512v2.fa`
*   **Subsampling Strategy:** The dataset includes genomes from the top 250 most prevalent Pangolin lineages. For each lineage, up to 1,000 genomes were randomly sampled (`random_state=42`). The exclusion of the `Unassigned` lineage resulted in 249 final clades.
*   **Tools:** The pipeline uses `matUtils` (v0.5.8+) and `bcftools` (v1.18+).
